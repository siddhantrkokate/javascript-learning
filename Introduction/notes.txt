# Javascript is the langauage of web.

# We have two ways to link js.
1. Internal - 
 - Here we integrates directly inside HTML Page.
 - By using <script></script> tag.

2. External - 
 - We use this method in large projects which has multiple files.
 - For this we uses .js file inside which we writes the Javascript code.
 - For embbeding with HTML we uses <script src="filePath"></script>

# In Js we do not need to use (;) semicolons requiredly, it is optional to use.

# Also Js follows top to down apprach where thing comes first executes first.
e.g., if we have code of 10 lines it will start from line one then will come on line 2 and so on.

# in Js for output something we have - console.log() 
this function shows or prints the things happening in background. In short for developers to know.
