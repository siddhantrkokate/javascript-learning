# Variable is the memory which stores the data.
# It is the refrance of that memory.

# In Js we have 3 ways to declare a variable.
# Using var, let, const.

# Js is a loosly typed language where it detects data type of variable at runntime.
# We do not need to mention it.

# var - 
 - Scope is global. (we can access that variable outside the scope or between anywhere in program).
 - It can be redeclare or initialize many times.

# let - 
 - It is local scope. (can access inside only declared scope.)
 - can be declare ones but initialize multiple times.

# const - 
 - It is also local scope.
 - But for single time while declaring we need to initialize the value.
 - And we cannot modify it further. 
 - Best used in production ready softwares.
